##FaceMatcher
A project for memory development - guess who are all these people and score! WIP, beta testing stage is nearing the completion. The app is supposed to be generic, all you need to have is a set of thumbnails (i.e. in .png format) that should go into raw folder of this Android project and a .json file that would have an array of entries with name/image information. See people.json file for an example.

##Sample Screenshots
Screenshots have been produced with the generic data that come with the project.
